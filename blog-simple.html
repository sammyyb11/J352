        <p><bold>My obsession with Percy Jackson began in 2011. I was browsing my fourth grade library when I stumbled upon <em> The Lightning Thief</em>. I devoured it right before spring break. I brought the next book home to read over the course of spring break, but I finished it in a day. I was hooked. I remember not knowing he had written more books until I found them at the school library, and the cycle began again. There were years where my mom picked me and my best friend up on release day every year so we could race to Barnes and Noble and grab a copy of whatever he had written. Now that two new books with the original characters are coming out, I'm excited to dive back in.</bold> </p>

        <p><bold>Criminal Minds is a more recent obsession of mine. I watched all 15 seasons in one month while I was in high school which is quite a feat. During quarantine, I watched it again, and the day after I finished it, I hit replay on the first episode. While the show is very far from perfect, something about the characters just draws you in. The cast, however, has changed a lot since the first season.</bold> </p>
