<h1> Donna Tartt's Literary Selection </h1></div>

<h2>The Secret History: 5/5</h2>
<img src="images/TSH.jpeg" align="right">
<p> Tartt exploded onto the scene with The Secret History, her debut novel, published in 1992. The novel is about a college student named Richard who studies classics at a small university in New England (sound familiar?).</p>

<p> Tartt, like Richard, also studied classics in school. That was far from the last aspect of Tartt's college life she took inspiration from to write The Secret History. Bunny, who gets murdered (not a spoiler), was based on her best friend at school. Tartt even dedicated the book to him. </p>

<p>Richard arrives in New England from California and finds himself fascinated with the tight-knit group studing classics. After weaseling himself into the classes, he finds himself enamored with their odd habbits and strange dynamics. Soon into the school year, things turn from strange to deadly. The story is told in two parts: before and after the murder of Bunny. As things begin to fall apart, the remaining students do as well. </p>


<p> To me, this book is more than a book. It kicked off a swarm of people trying to repeat the allure of Tartt's success, spawning a genre called Dark Academia people continue to write about to this day. It's a biting satire about the dangers of elitism and what happens when you isolate yourself from the outside world for too long. These characters, despite being some of the most annoying people ever written, have a way of drawing you in. You can't figure out who to root for (except for Bunny [again not a spoiler]). Despite being over 500 pages long, the curiosities and complexities of the characters make it difficult to put it down. Don't get me wrong, it's a slow read, but it's a slow read with purpose. </p>
