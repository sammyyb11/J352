<h2> The Early Years</h2>
<p> Born in Mississippi in 1963, Tartt became interested in writing from an early age. After one year at the University of Mississippi, Tartt transferrred to Bennington College, home to famous alum and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/09/bennington-college-with-bret-easton-ellis-donna-tartt-jonathan-lethem" target="_blank">scandal.</a>
</p>



<h2> The Beginning </h2>
<p> Six years after graduating, Tartt wrote her first novel, titled the Secret History. The book was well received. Vanity Fair called Tartt a "precocious literary genius." After publishing, Tartt disappeared from the novel world, although she continued to publish short stories and nonfiction works. </p>

<h2> The Early 2000's </h2>
<p> She reemerged 10 years later in 2002 with The Little Friend. The novel follows the main character, Harriet Dufresnes, after her brother's murder and includes themes of Christianity, loss, and family. Tartt said her goal was to make this book the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/27/fiction.features" target="_blank">opposite of The Secret History.</a></p>
<p> While this novel received less commercial success than her other works, The Little Friend still received praise from critics. It won the WH Smith Literary award and was nominated for the Orange Prize for Fiction.  </p>





<h2> Most Recently </h2>
<p> Like before, Tartt disappeared for another 10 years before publishing The Goldfinch in 2013. The Goldfinch is her most decorated book. Tartt won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014 and the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. The New York Times included it its list of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/books/review/the-10-best-books-of-2013.html/" target="_blank"> best books of 2013. </a></p>

<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>Very little is known about Tartt's private life, but <a href="https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/interview-the-very-very-private-life-of-ms-donna-tartt-29780543.html" target="blank_"> she says</a> it's not because she's a recluse; it's because she's not on Facebook. From <a href="https://www.virginialiving.com/culture/arresting-images/" target="_blank">interviews</a> with her partner, a gallery owner named Neal Guma, we know they live together. Beyond that, Tartt chooses not to reveal how she spends her time. A lot of it must be spent writing, however, since she spends 10 years on each novel, a period of time she calls tortorous. </p>
