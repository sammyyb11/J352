<h1> Donna Tartt's Literary Selection </h1></div>

<h2>The Secret History: 5/5</h2>
<img src="images/TSH.jpeg" align="right">
<p> Tartt exploded onto the scene with The Secret History, her debut novel, published in 1992. The novel is about a college student named Richard who studies classics at a small university in New England (sound familiar?).</p>

<p> Tartt, like Richard, also studied classics in school. That was far from the last aspect of Tartt's college life she took inspiration from to write The Secret History. Bunny, who gets murdered (not a spoiler), was based on her best friend at school. Tartt even dedicated the book to him. </p>

<p>Richard arrives in New England from California and finds himself fascinated with the tight-knit group studing classics. After weaseling himself into the classes, he finds himself enamored with their odd habbits and strange dynamics. Soon into the school year, things turn from strange to deadly. The story is told in two parts: before and after the murder of Bunny. As things begin to fall apart, the remaining students do as well. </p>


<p> To me, this book is more than a book. It kicked off a swarm of people trying to repeat the allure of Tartt's success, spawning a genre called Dark Academia people continue to write about to this day. It's a biting satire about the dangers of elitism and what happens when you isolate yourself from the outside world for too long. These characters, despite being some of the most annoying people ever written, have a way of drawing you in. You can't figure out who to root for (except for Bunny [again not a spoiler]). Despite being over 500 pages long, the curiosities and complexities of the characters make it difficult to put it down. Don't get me wrong, it's a slow read, but it's a slow read with purpose. </p>

<h2>The Little Friend: Unread</h2>
<img src="images/TheLittleFriend.jpeg" align="left" height="190">
<p> I have not personally read this book YET. It is on my TBR and I will get to it someday. But until that day comes, it would be unfair of me to rate this book. I will, however, give you a summary.</p>

<p> The Little Friend is about a young girl whose older brother was murdered 10 yeras ago. When the story picks up, she is trying to solve his murder. This book also focuses on her family history.</p>

<h2>The Goldfinch: 4/5</h2>
<img src="images/TheGoldfinch.png" align="right">
<p>The Goldfinch follows a young boy, Theo, after his mother is killed in an explosion in an art museum. Theo was with her but survived, taking a famous painting, The Goldfinch, with him when he escaped. It soon becomes far too late to return the painting, and which each passing year Theo's anxiety grows. </p>
<p>This book was just as baffling in her debut, but in a different way. We watch Theo grow up and make questionable choice after questionable choice. And when I say questionable I mean questionable. Rather than a relatively short timeline, we follow him for over a decade. We seem him live with his father and make a friend who helps lead Theo down a treacherous road. We see him live in New York with an adoptive father figure for close to ten years. All the while his obsessions- The Goldfinch and a young girl who also survived the explosion- start to consume him.</p>
<p>To me this book was more weird than a commentary on anything like Tartt's first book. It was also very hard for me to read about all the terrible decisions Theo made. He might've done better if he just flipped a coin. The third act is particularly troublesome for reasons I can't disclose due to spoilers. Did this book deserve a Pulitzer Prize? Maybe. It was certainly weird and depressing enough to qualify. Overall, it was not as good as her first book, but still an entertaining read. </p>
