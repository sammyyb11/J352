<p>“I’m tired.” “My sleep schedule is ruined.” “I need caffeine.” It feels like a requirement to say these words at least once a day. For college students, a lack of sleep is not just a possibility, but an expectation. Whether students are bragging about the all nighter they had to pull last week or racing to the campus coffee shop to buy their second cup of coffee of the day, exhaustion, and all its side effects, is a hot topic on college campuses. </p>

<p>The National Sleep Foundation recommends adults age 18 or older get at least seven hours of sleep every night. According to a survey conducted with 44 college students, only 55% of college students are hitting that mark every night.</p>

 <h4>“I’m tired.”</h4>

<p>Theo Ng, a sophomore at the University of Maryland, says they feel it when they get five or less hours of sleep.</p>

<p>“My eyes hurt, my reflexes and spatial awareness are slow and inhibited,” they said.</p>

<p>A lack of sleep, whether it’s chronic or for just one night, can cause side effects, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Not getting enough sleep one night can cause daytime fatigue, irritability, and slow reaction time. Repeated lack of sleep can cause impulsivity or worsen mental health problems. </p>

<p>Part of the reason why poor sleep is such a pattern for college students is because of bad “sleep hygiene”, or a bad sleep schedule. Many things can impact a person’s sleep schedule, including anxiety or sleep disorders. The National Institute of Public Health even lists “university” as one of the reasons. </p>

<p>Another thing listed was excessive caffeine. </p>

<h4>“I need caffeine.”</h4>

<p>It is only natural that a group of people suffering from a lack of sleep would turn to a known solution: caffeine. Exactly 50% of respondents said they drink one or more cups of coffee every day, and over 20% of respondents said they drink at least one energy drink a day.</p> 

<p>The FDA recommends drinking less than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, the equivalent of five cups of coffee. On average, the amount of caffeine in an energy drink is about 74 milligrams. They also, however, contain other stimulants, such as taurine, according to the CDC. </p>
<p>Overall, some caffeine is not only okay, but healthy. The American Heart Association says a moderate amount of caffeine may decrease the risk of depression, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and other illnesses. </p>

<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12">
<p>Exceeding that 400 milligram limit, however, may lead to anxiety, heart palpitations, and trouble sleeping. </p>

<p>The other risk of long term caffeine intake is caffeine dependence. Giuliana Reilly, a junior at Salve Regina University, has two cups of coffee and an energy drink every day. On days when she does not have any caffeine, she says she can feel the difference. </p>

<p>“I get headaches and notice I am more irritable,” she said. </p>

<p>The negative effects of caffeine can go beyond having an impact on your body. There is also an economic impact to consider. Nearly 55% of respondents said they buy coffee at least once a week. Around 20% of respondents said they buy coffee nearly every day, which adds up during the year. If someone buys a $4 iced coffee every day, they could easily spend a few hundred dollars each year.

  <h4>Improving Habits</h4>

<p>Poor sleep will lead to negative side effects. Caffeine may be used to offset some of these symptoms, but too much reliance on caffeine can lead to its own issues. The best way to stave off the effects of too little sleep is to get more sleep. </p>

<p>Having a good sleep schedule can be hard for college students, who have unreliable schedules even during their waking hours, but the Cleveland Clinic says getting into a good routine about sleep can help regulate sleep. Avoid looking at electronics and caffeine before bed. Improving sleep habits could help improve life overall.</p>
