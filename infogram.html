        <p style="font-style: Schibsted-Grotesk;">In 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit against Navient following years of complaints. <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank"> A settlement was reached</a> in 2020, leading to restitution payments for some and cancelled loans for others. Navient was accused of not acting with its customers in mind. </p>

        <p>Despite the settlement, people continue to file complaints through the <a href= "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2023-04-19&date_received_min=2020-04-19&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends" target="_blank"> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>. Over half of all complaints about <a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank">Navient</a> from the last three months came from the Southern region of the U.S. The number of complaints from the Northeast is relatively proportional to its share of the U.S. population, but the number of complaints from the South is about 14 percentage points higher than its share of the poulation. Similary, the rates of complaints from the West and Midwest are about six and eight percentage points lower. The South is overrepresented in these complaints while the West and Midwest are underrepresented.  </p>

        <p>The five states with the largest populations are included in the top 10 states with the most complaints against Navient. However, New York and Pennsylvania, both states in the Northeast region of the U.S., have less complaints than Georgia, a state in the South. Florida and Texas are also in the South. Despite being the largest state in the country, it has only the third highest number of complaints againts Navient. five of the 10 states are in the south. There are three states from the Northeast, one in the West, and one in the Midwest. It is important to note that there are more states in the Southern region of the U.S. than any other region. Despite having the least amount of states in its region, nine, three out of 10 of the states with the highest number of complaints were from that region.
